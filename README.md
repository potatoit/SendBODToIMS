# SendBODToIMS

This is a quick little application which will leverage the ION APIs to send a BOD to ION via IMS.  
  
Though you can do this with a tool like Postman, you would need to escape the BOD itself.  This little application will escape the BOD.

The .ionapi Client ID (ci) must match Client ID in the ION IMS connector.
